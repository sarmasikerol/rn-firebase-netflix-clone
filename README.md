ÅŸuan okay mi # ðŸ“± React Native Firebase Messaging App

This project is a mobile application built with **React Native**.  
It integrates **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** to receive push notifications,  
handles **Deep Linking** to navigate to specific screens when a notification is tapped,  
and uses **Redux Toolkit** for global state management.  
All incoming notifications are also stored in **Firebase Firestore** and can be listed in the app.  
The project is structured based on the **MVVM** architecture.
